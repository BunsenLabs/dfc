Patches are welcome!

Just keep in mind the following:

  * keep the same coding style
  * use c89 (the only exception being for using uint64_t type)
  * your code must fit in 80 columns wide with a TAB of 8
  * always check what a function returns if it is non-void. If you do not care
    about what's returned, explicitly declare it by casting it to void.
  * preferably use 'git format patch' to generate your patch
  * your patch must improve dfc in one way or another

If this is OK, you can send your patch via email to the author:

	Robin Hahling: <robin.hahling@gw-computing.net>

OR, better solution, register to the official website:

	http://projects.gw-computing.net/projects/dfc

and add an issue with your patch attached.

Thanks for making dfc better!
